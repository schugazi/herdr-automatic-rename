# herdr-automatic-rename - one plugin, two toggleable features:
#
#   NAME_TABS=1   auto-name each tab after its foreground program, or the shell
#                 name at a bare prompt (manual renames opt a tab out). Applies
#                 to tabs only.
#   AUTO_INDEX=1  prefix each workspace, tab, and agent with the 1-9 number of
#                 its jump keybind (switch_workspace/switch_tab/focus_agent) as
#                 "[N] <base>". Per-scope overrides AUTO_INDEX_WORKSPACES,
#                 AUTO_INDEX_TABS and AUTO_INDEX_AGENTS each default to
#                 AUTO_INDEX and win over it when set, so "numbered tabs, plain
#                 workspaces" is AUTO_INDEX_WORKSPACES=0 on its own (issue #8).
#                 Agents are numbered only on herdr < 0.7.5 (newer herdr rejects
#                 a bracketed agent name outright, see ar_agent_prefix_ok) and
#                 only when the panel is grouped-sorted ("priority" sort reorders
#                 the panel behind an API we can't read, see ar_agent_sort).
#                 Agent prefixes are stripped in both cases.
#
# Naming a kind and switching it off does not merely stop numbering: its pass
# still runs and strips the prefixes already there, so the change is visible on
# the next event rather than waiting for the "clear" action (see ar_reconcile).
# Nothing records which prefixes we wrote, so that strip also takes a hand-typed
# "[1] incident" down to "incident"; ar_strip_prefix's all-digits rule is the
# whole of the protection, and it is what keeps "[wip] foo" intact.
#
# Which is why it is the NAMING that arms it, not the value. A config carrying
# only AUTO_INDEX=0 predates these settings, has never had us touch its
# workspace or agent labels, and keeps that no-op behavior on upgrade. Tabs are
# the exception, and only because they were already stripped this way whenever
# NAME_TABS was on.
#
# Both default on and are configured in config.sh ($HERDR_AUTOMATIC_RENAME_CONFIG). A
# single unified reconcile drives both: one pass computes a tab's base name and
# its "[N]" prefix together and issues one rename per item, so a brand-new tab
# settles at "[3] zsh" in a single rename with no placeholder flicker.
#
# Invoked several ways, all routing through ar_run:
#   * herdr [[events]] hooks:     automatic-rename.sh <event.name>
#   * shell preexec/precmd hooks: automatic-rename.sh preexec "<cmdline>"
#                                 automatic-rename.sh precmd [<shell-name>]
#   * the "reset" action:         automatic-rename.sh reset      (re-adopt active tab)
#   * the "clear" action:         automatic-rename.sh --clear    (strip all prefixes)
#   * the "doctor" action:        automatic-rename.sh doctor     (explain the active tab's name)
#
# The live per-command hooks ship with the plugin under shell/ (hook.zsh,
# hook.bash, hook.fish); each passes its own shell name to precmd so a bare
# prompt in a bash/fish pane reads "bash"/"fish" rather than $SHELL.
#
# herdr has no per-tab metadata and no auto/manual flag, so the manual-rename
# exclusion is tracked here: a JSON state file remembers the last base we set
# per tab_id and whether auto-naming is still enabled for it. Config and state
# live at FIXED paths (not $HERDR_PLUGIN_{CONFIG,STATE}_DIR) so the herdr-invoked
# and shell-invoked runs share the same store, one per herdr session: the
# preexec/precmd runs are launched by the shell, not herdr, and never receive
# the HERDR_PLUGIN_* env vars. Needs jq.
#
# Targets bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash): no associative arrays, no namerefs.

# Resolve our own directory so `. "$AR_ROOT/naming.sh"` works whether herdr runs
# us (HERDR_PLUGIN_ROOT is set), we are executed directly, or we are SOURCED by
# the test suite. BASH_SOURCE[0] points at this file in all three cases; $0 would

# `task` is the shape a TITLE arrives in: control characters gone, the leading run
# of non-alphanumerics gone (an agent parks a spinner glyph there), the agent's own
# brand gone with it, no trailing space, and inner runs of it collapsed. One
# normalization, because the refusals in ar_title_clean compare exact strings and
# the label is what they compared: a title of "Claude Code " used to match no
# refusal and then be trimmed into a label.
#
# The brand is the argument, because it belongs to the agent in the pane and each
# lift knows which one that is. `brandmap` turns $AR_TITLE_BRANDS (TITLE_BRANDS,
# newline-joined) into the table `taskof` looks it up in, and `debrand` takes the
# brand off only at the very front and only when a non-alphanumeric follows it, so a
# title that merely starts with it keeps it. `lead` runs on BOTH sides of the
# debrand: a title arrives with anything in front of the brand -- a control
# character clean turned into a space, herdr's own leading whitespace, a glyph an
# agent parked there -- and the compare is against the front of the string, so the
# brand has to be at the front by then (see TITLE_BRANDS in naming.sh, issue #12).
# Only a pane whose agent HAS a brand pays for either, which is why the pair sits
# behind one length test: for everything else the second strip could never match.
#
# These four live in their own string because only the two title lifts call them,
# and $AR_JQ_CLEAN is prefixed onto five other jq programs that would compile them
# for nothing. Concatenate it AFTER $AR_JQ_CLEAN, which is where `clean` and `lc`
# come from.
#
# Every jq below that hands a herdr-supplied string to a shell variable runs it
# through clean first, and joins its rows on a literal tab rather than using @tsv.
# @tsv keeps a row parseable by ESCAPING what would break it, and those escapes
# are the problem: a tab out of argv arrives as the two printable characters \t,
# which no scrub can tell from text somebody typed, and every backslash in the
# value is doubled on the way past -- numbering a tab called "C:\temp" rewrote it
# to "C:\\temp". Removing the control characters instead makes the row

# ar_state_seed - a named session's first store starts from the ownership records
# of the shared store it replaces. Without this an upgrade opts every named tab
# out: the tab carries a label the empty store never wrote, which is what a hand
# rename looks like. Only enabled records are copied. A matching one keeps the
# tab named, a mismatched one opts out exactly as no record would, and an
# opted-out one is left behind so a placeholder label is adopted as it would be
# from nothing. Ids this session lacks go on the first prune. The link is what
# makes the copy safe under a burst of first events: it refuses an existing
# file, so a pass that already wrote is never covered over.
#
# Every copied record is marked `seeded`, and the mark is what makes the second
# sentence above true. The root store is not only the store an upgrade leaves
# behind: it is the DEFAULT session's live store, and it stays populated for as
# long as anybody uses that session. So a session created later seeds from it
# too, and because every herdr server numbers its tabs from w1:t1 the copied
# record lands on a tab that has nothing to do with it. That tab still carries
# herdr's generated number, and an owned record against a placeholder label is
# what a hand rename looks like -- so the session's own first tab opted itself
# out for good, needing the reset action per tab, which is this bug one layer
# along. A seeded record is a claim about another store's tab rather than a
# write of ours, so ar_name_eligible confirms it against the label and drops it
# when the label disagrees, leaving the tab exactly as unseen as it really is.
#
# Nothing has to clear the mark: ar_state_set writes a record whole, so the
# first write of ours replaces it. A seeded record that MATCHES its label keeps
# the mark, and costs nothing for it -- the label agrees, so the record is ours
# in everything but provenance, and a later hand rename reaches the same

# ar_state_read -> the state object as JSON, or "{}" when the file is missing OR
# unparseable. The two are the same answer: nothing is known about any tab. They
# used to differ, and that is the bug -- every writer below starts from this file,
# so one jq could not parse froze the store forever. The tab whose ownership went
# with it reads as hand-renamed on the next pass, opts out, and the reset action
# cannot bring it back either, since re-adopting it is another write. Naming was
# dead for the session with nothing said and no way back but deleting the file.
#
# It answers with ONE object, and slurps to be sure of it. jq reads top-level
# values as a STREAM, so `type == "object"` alone says yes to a file holding two
# of them and hands the pair straight back: the writers then apply their update
# to each document and write both out, so that file stays multi-document for
# good, and ar_state_get starts emitting one value per document into a variable
# no comparison in the opt-out machine can match. Requiring `length == 1` is
# what makes "unreadable" cover every shape a state file can be broken into.
# An array or a bare null is refused for the same reason: it parses, it is not a
# store, and assigning a key into it is not a write this file can come back from.
#
# One extra jq per write is what validating costs. Writes are the rare path,

# computed, which is the steady state for every named tab on every event.

# alt+N resolves through that visible order (herdr's workspace_at_visible_position
# -> visible_workspace_order), NOT the raw `workspace list` array order, so this
# mirrors herdr's own workspace_list_entries_inner (src/ui/sidebar.rs). Keep the
# rules in this one place, in herdr's order, so re-checking them against upstream
# stays cheap:
#   * Workspaces sharing a .worktree.repo_key nest into one "space", but ONLY when
#     the repo has 2+ open workspaces AND one of them is the main checkout
#     (is_linked_worktree false). Two linked worktrees with no main workspace stay
#     separate top-level rows in array order.
#   * A space renders at the slot of its first-appearing member, and the row that
#     heads it is the MAIN checkout, with the other members nested after it in
#     array order, so a worktree listed before its main repo does not lead.
#   * A COLLAPSED space renders its head row alone. Its other members are hidden,
#     which is what position 0 means. The one exception herdr makes is the FOCUSED
#     member: a collapsed space keeps the active workspace rendered under its
#     parent, so that row still counts and every row after it shifts down. Numbers
#     therefore move when the user only collapses, expands, or switches workspaces.
