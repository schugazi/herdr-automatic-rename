# transcript.sh - what a coding agent's own session says it is about.
#
# Sourced by automatic-rename.sh, beside naming.sh, icons.sh and git.sh. Like
# git.sh it reads the filesystem, which is why it is in neither of the other two.
# Unlike git.sh it is not cheap -- two bounded reads and a jq -- so where that
# module is called for every named tab, this one is called only where a pane has
# an agent, a session id, and a terminal title that said nothing. A titled agent
# never reaches it.
#
# An agent that has titled its terminal has already said what it is doing, and
# AGENT_TITLES reads that (see ar_title_clean). This answers when it has not,
# which is a repeatable case rather than an edge: Claude Code derives its
# terminal title from what the user typed, so a session opened with a slash
# command and answered by the agent alone is never given one, and its tab reads
# "claude" however long it runs.
#
# Only Claude Code is read, and the pane's agent is checked rather than assumed:
# every agent keeps its transcript in its own shape and its own place, so another
# agent's pane carrying a session value -- its own, or one a claude left behind
# there -- would otherwise put one agent's prompts on another agent's tab. The
# shape is undocumented besides, so a transcript that stops carrying these fields
# yields nothing and the tab is named as it was before this existed, which is the
# failure mode to have.
#
# Checked on its own by shellcheck, where the AR_TRANSCRIPT_* globals it answers
# through have no reader in sight: the engine next door is what reads them.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
