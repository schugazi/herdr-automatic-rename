# herdr-automatic-rename: live per-command tab auto-naming (bash).
#
# herdr has no "foreground command changed" event, so this hook drives the
# real-time updates: preexec names the tab after the starting command, precmd
# names it after the shell once back at the prompt. Everything else (tab
# switches, numbering, agents) comes from the plugin's herdr [[events]].
#
# bash has no native preexec, and the DEBUG trap + PROMPT_COMMAND are SHARED,
# exclusive resources that tools like atuin, bash-preexec, ble.sh and starship
# rely on. Overwriting either silently breaks them, so we cooperate:
#   * If preexec_functions / precmd_functions already exist (the bash-preexec /
#     atuin convention), just register into them -- that framework owns the trap
#     and calls us with the command line as $1. Nothing to clobber.
#   * Otherwise drive precmd from PROMPT_COMMAND and preexec from a DEBUG trap,
#     but install the DEBUG trap ONLY if no other tool has one (checked via
#     `trap -p DEBUG`). If one exists we leave it alone and skip live preexec;
#     precmd still runs.
#
# Source this AFTER your prompt / history tools so their arrays already exist:
#   source /path/to/herdr-automatic-rename/shell/hook.bash
#
# No-ops outside a herdr pane and when the engine is not found. Needs bash 3.1+.

# Resolve the engine next to this file so the hook works wherever the plugin
# lives. BASH_SOURCE[0] is the sourced file even inside the functions below
# (bash 3.0+); resolve to an absolute, symlink-safe dir so a later `cd` in the
# shell can't invalidate the path.
